"""
sources/naukri.py
Naukri fresher/intern listings via Naukri's real search API.

--- CHANGED in this pass ---
  - Added explicit login-wall / auth-block detection. Naukri's API can
    respond with 200 but an HTML login/captcha page instead of real JSON,
    or with 401/403, when it decides this traffic needs a logged-in
    session. Previously this just looked like a generic "JSON parse error"
    with no clear signal of WHY. Now detected explicitly and logged as
    such, and triggers the circuit breaker immediately (no point retrying
    more queries against an active login requirement).
  - Reduced default query count (top 5), added circuit breaker on
    consecutive failures, increased inter-query delay — unchanged from
    last pass.
